This "library" is not mine.
I "borrowed" it from some other guys, and since the license allows it, that should be fine, right.

Here is their license text.

Of course on the [real repository of this library](https://github.com/kikito/md5.lua) you'll most likely find the latest version, as this version "could" be outdated.
If this version is outdated, by all means let me know by writing an issue, or send me the newest version through a pull-request.

If this file (which is unmodified, as my builder fully supports this file) is all you want, I suggest it's better to retreive it at the original repository. If you wanted my entire colleciton anyway, then why bother ;)
