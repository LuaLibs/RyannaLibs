[rem]

This library works differently from what is regular for Ryanna.
That is because Ryanna normally uses a structure that not all libraries and engines may be compatible with.

This file will therefore have to take over.

[vars]
require=getitall.lua

[list:FILES]

[list:PUREDIRS]
jumper

[list:BUILDNOTES]
Jumper is a special library.
If you use it your project may NOT have the /jumper folder present as jumper needs it for its own and conflicts then arise if you have one!
