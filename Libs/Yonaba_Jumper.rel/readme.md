This library is not written by me. 
I only wrote the "glue" code in order to make it fit in Ryanna projects, the original lua files are taken directly from [this repository](https://github.com/Yonaba/Jumper) and have not been touched by my hands, but they remained in their original form.

The getitall.lua file contains the "glue" code. 
The RyannaBuild.gini file contains the config Ryanna will follow for this specific library to prevent compatibility errors.
