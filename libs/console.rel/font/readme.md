# Font: Calling Code

This font was downloaded from DaFont. Contrary to some data on DaFont this font is NOT open source but it has an open license anyway.
Read the license.txt file to see the license notes.

# Note:
In the .oristuff dir you can find the original downloaded archive. Ryanna will not merge that in project because Ryanna has been coded to ignore hidden files and directories (that is hidden in Unix style so prefixed with a period. The Windows 'Hidden' attribute is not taken into account for that).
